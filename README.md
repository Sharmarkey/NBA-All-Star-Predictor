# NBA HIGH SCORER PREDICTOR
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that builds and evaluates binary classification models (logistic regression and random forest) to predict whether an NBA player-season will be a ‘high scorer’ based on per-game statistics. It includes end-to-end data cleaning and parsing, feature scaling, 5‑fold cross‑validation, ROC/AUROC analysis, feature importance insights, and a brief look at ethical considerations in sports analytics
