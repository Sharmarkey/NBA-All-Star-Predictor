# NBA High‑Scorer Predictor

> A hands‑on machine‑learning project that guesses which NBA player‑seasons rank among the league’s top scorers, using only per‑game stats.

This repo includes a single Jupyter Notebook that:

- **Loads & cleans** 1980–2022 NBA per‑game data  
- **Parses & engineers** features (e.g. minutes played → decimals)  
- **Scales** stats for fair comparisons  
- Trains **Logistic Regression** & **Random Forest** classifiers  
- Evaluates with **5‑fold cross‑validation** and **ROC/AUROC** analysis  
- Ranks **feature importance** to reveal what really drives high scoring  
- Wraps up with **ethical considerations** in sports analytics
